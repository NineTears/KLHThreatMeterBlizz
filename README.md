# This AddOn requires KLHThreatMeter to work which is NOT included

KLHThreatMeterBlizz adds a small threat indicator to your target frame that will also change color depending on your current threat.

If you want to use this addon with custom target frames
-----------------------

1) use the following command
	/ktmsnap
2) move cursor to desired frame (dark overlay will indicate active frame)
3) left click
4) fine tune position
5) right click

To reset to default state use this command
	/ktmsnap reset


The addon shows data directly from KLHThreatMeter, which unfortunetly means that it will **not** be accurate when there are many monsters around and there is no work around this in 1.12 patch. Sorry!
